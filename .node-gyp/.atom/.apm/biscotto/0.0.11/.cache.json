The underlying architecture is based on [codo](https://github.com/netzpirat/codo); however, this uses [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) notation, instead of JSDoc.\n\n## Features\n\n* Detects classes, methods, constants, mixins & concerns.\n* Generates a nice site to browse your code documentation in various ways.\n# JSON output\n\n## Text processing\n\n### TomDoc Notation\n\nAPI documentation should be written in the [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) notation.  \nOriginally conceived for Ruby, TomDoc lends itself pretty nicely to Coffeescript.\nThere are some slight changes in the parse rules to match Coffeescript.\nBriefly, here's a list of how you should format your documentation:\n\n#### Status types\n\nEvery class and method should start with one of three phrases: `Public:`, `Internal:`,\nand `Private:`. You can flag whether or not to include Internal and Private members\nvia the options.\n\n#### Method arguments\n\nEach method argument starts with the argument name, followed by a dash (`-`), and\nthe description of the argument:\n\n```\nargument - Some word about the arg!\n```\n\nHash options are placed on a newline and end with a colon:\n\n```\noptions - These are the options:\n          key1: Blah blah.\n          key2: Blah\n```\n\nIf a description has a default value, define it at the end of the\ndescription with `(default: <desc>)`.\n\n#### Return types\n\nWhen returning from a method, your line should start with the word `Returns`. When\ndescribing the return type, wrap it in the link reference notation (two curly braces,\nlike this: `{ }`). This ensures that the generated methods correlates a return type.\nMethods without return types returned `undefined`. You can list more than one `Returns`\nper method by separating each type on a different line.\n\n### Status Blocks\n\nYou can flag methods in a file with the following syntax:\n\n```coffee\n### Public ###\n```\n\nThat will mark every method underneath that block as `Public`. You can follow the\nsame notion for `Internal` as well.\n\nYou can have as many block status flags as you want. The amount of `#`s must be at\nleast three, and you can have any text inside the block you want. For example:\n\n```coffee\n### Internal: This does some secret stuff. ###\n```\n\nIf you specify a status for a method within a block, the status is respected.\nFor example:\n\n\n```coffee\n### Public ###\n\n# Internal: A secret method\nnotShown: ->\n\nshown: ->\n```\n\n`shown` is kept as Public because of the status block, while `notShown` is indeed Internal.\n\n### GitHub Flavored Markdown\n\nBiscotto documentation is processed with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).\n\n### Automatically link references\n\nBiscotto comments and all tag texts will be parsed for references to other classes, methods and mixins, and are automatically\nlinked. The reference searching will not take place within code blocks, thus you can avoid reference searching errors\nby surround your code block that contains curly braces with backticks.\n\nThere are several ways of link types supported and all can take an optional label after the link.\n\n* Normal URL links: `{http://coffeescript.org/}` or `[Try CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)`\n* Link to a class or mixin: `{Animal.Lion}` or `[The mighty lion]{Animal.Lion}`\n* Direct link to an instance method: `{Animal.Lion.walk}` or `[The lion walks]{Animal.Lion.walk}`\n* Direct link to a class method: `{Animal.Lion@constructor}` or `[A new king was born]{Animal.Lion@constructor}`\n\nIf you are referring to a method within the same class, you can omit the class name: `{#walk}` or `{.constructor}`.\n\n### Delegation\n\nIf you're writing methods that do the exact same thing as another method, you can\nchoose to copy over the documentation via _delegation_. For example:\n\n```coffee\n# {Delegates to: .delegatedRegular}\ndelegatedMethod: ->\n\n# Public: I'm being delegated to!\n# \n# a - A {Number}\n# b - A {String}\n#\n# Returns a {Boolean}\ndelegatedRegular: (a, b) ->\n```\n\n`delegatedMethod` has the same arguments, return type, and documentation as \n`delegatedRegular`. You can also choose to delegate to a different class:\n\n```coffee\n# Private: {Delegates to: Another.Class@somewhere}\ndelegatedMethod: ->\n```\n\nClasses that are delegated should still set their own statuses. For example, if\n`Another.Class@somewhere` is Public, `delegatedMethod` is still marked as `Private`.\nThe same documentation remains.\n\n### Examples\n\nFor more technical examples, peruse the [spec](./spec) folder, which contains all\nthe tests for Biscotto.\n\n## Generate\n\nAfter the installation, you will have a `biscotto` binary that can be used to generate the documentation recursively for all CoffeeScript files within a directory.\n\nTo view a list of commands, type\n\n```bash\n$ biscotto --help\n```\n\nBiscotto wants to be smart and tries to detect the best default settings for the sources, the readme, the extra files, and\nthe project name, so the above defaults may be different on your project.\n\n### Project defaults\n\nYou can define your project defaults by writing your command line options to a `.biscottoopts` file:\n\n```bash\n--name       \"Biscotto\"\n--readme     README.md\n--title      \"Biscotto Documentation\"\n--private\n--quiet\n--output-dir ./doc\n./src\n-\nLICENSE\nCHANGELOG.md\n```\n\nPut each option flag on a separate line, followed by the source directories or files, and optionally any extra file that\nshould be included into the documentation separated by a dash (`-`). If your extra file has the extension `.md`, it'll\nbe rendered as Markdown.\n\n## Keyboard navigation\n\nYou can quickly search and jump through the documentation by using the fuzzy finder dialog:\n\n* Open fuzzy finder dialog: `Ctrl-T`\n\nIn frame mode you can toggle the list naviation frame on the left side:\n\n* Toggle list view: `Ctrl-L`\n\nYou can focus a list in frame mode or toggle a tab in frameless mode:\n\n* Class list: `Ctrl-C`\n* Mixin list: `Ctrl-I`\n* File list: `Ctrl-F`\n* Method list: `Ctrl-M`\n* Extras list: `Ctrl-E`\n\nYou can focus and blur the search input:\n\n* Focus search input: `Ctrl-S`\n* Blur search input: `Esc`\n\nIn frameless mode you can close the list tab:\n\n* Close list tab: `Esc`\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Garen J.
