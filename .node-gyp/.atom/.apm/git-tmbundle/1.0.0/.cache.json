The Git Textmate Bundle.\n\nRelease 1.8.0 [2009-07-31]\n\n\"James Conroy-Finn\":http://github.com/jcf is the new maintainer of this bundle. If you have cloned the bundle from Tim Harper's repository, please update your git config settings to point to his repository:\n\n<pre>\n  cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Git.tmbundle\n  git config remote.origin.url git://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle.git\n</pre>\n\nThanks -- the management\n\nh2. Installation\n\nYou can install this bundle in TextMate by opening the preferences and going to the bundles tab. After installation it will be automatically updated for you.\n\n* In the TextMate preferences, Variables, set the TM_GIT variable to point to your installation of git (ie <code>/usr/local/bin/git</code>)\n* Many shortcuts are available from the SCM shortcut ⌘Y  Subversion commands are ⌘⌥G.  Less frequent commands are accessed via the menu.\n\nh2. Support\n\n* \"Issue tracker\":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle/issues\n* \"Repository\":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle\n\nThe \"Mailing list\":http://groups.google.com/group/git-tmbundle has now been closed. Please feel free to report issues using the \"Issue tracker\":http://github.com/jcf/git-tmbundle/issues.\n\nh2. Theme notes:\n\nThe \"Git Commit Message\" Language defines two scopes that can be used by a theme to generate \"line too long\" warnings for the first line of the commit:\n\n* invalid.deprecated.line-too-long.git-commit\n* invalid.illegal.line-too-long.git-commit\n\nThe warning scope triggers when the first line exceeds 50 characters; the error scope over 65 characters. These aren't generally-used TextMate scopes, so you can add new rules to your preferred themes, such as orange background/red background. You can also edit the regex to change the preferred character counts.\n\nh2. Who:\n\nh3.
